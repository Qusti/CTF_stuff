Started with 'ping 10.10.11.194 -c 4' to make sure my vpn is up and machine is available
'nmap -p- -T4 10.10.11.194' to see which ports are open. Ports 22, 80 and 9091 were open so i scanned them again with 'nmap -sVC -p 22,80,9091 10.10.11.194' 
for better understanding of versions running in the backend. 
Added '10.10.11.194 soccer.htb' to my hosts file for website to work

'gobuster dir -u http://soccer.htb -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt' found that there is '/tiny' directory which has a login page
It is a Tiny file manager 2.4.3 which is vulnerable to path traversal
